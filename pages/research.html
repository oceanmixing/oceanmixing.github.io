<p><img src="/images/jr310/IMG_6096_thumb.jpg" align="right" width="300" /> This includes the meridional overturning circulation, large-scale heat flux dynamics, origin and fate of mesoscale energy, deep convection, biophysical interactions, and subpolar ocean dynamics. Research methods are centred on ocean observations, with an aim to capitalise on synergies between datatypes. This means using two or more datatypes (satellite, in situ hydrography, moorings or autonomous platforms) to gain a better understanding of ocean dynamics than would be possible from a single data source.</p>
