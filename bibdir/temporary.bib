	abstract={The abyssal ocean is primarily filled by cold, dense waters formed around Antarctica and collectively referred to as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). At steady state, AABW must be consumed in the ocean interior at the same rate it is produced, but how and where this consumption is achieved remains poorly understood. Here, we present estimates of abyssal water mass transformation by geothermal heating and parameterized internal wave-driven mixing. We use maps of the energy input to internal waves by tidal and geostrophic motions interacting with topography combined with assumptions about the distribution of energy dissipation to evaluate dianeutral transports induced by breaking internal tides and lee waves. Geothermal transformation is assessed based on a map of geothermal heat fluxes. Under the hypotheses underlying the constructed climatologies of buoyancy fluxes, we calculate that locally-dissipating internal tides and geothermal heating contribute respectively about 8 and 5 Sv of AABW consumption (upwelling), mostly north of 30$^\circ$S. In contrast, parameterized lee wave-driven mixing causes significant transformation only in the Southern Ocean, where it forms about 3 Sv of AABW, decreasing the mean density but enhancing the northward flow of abyssal waters. The possible role of remotely-dissipating internal tides in complementing AABW consumption is explored based on idealized distributions of mixing energy. Depending mostly on the chosen vertical structure, such mixing could drive 1 to 28 Sv of additional AABW upwelling, highlighting the need to better constrain the spatial distribution of remote dissipation. Though they carry large uncertainties, these climatological transformation estimates shed light on the qualitative functioning and key unknowns of the diabatic overturning.}

	abstract={In studies of ocean mixing, it is generally assumed that small-scale turbulent overturns lose 15%Ð20% of their energy in eroding the background stratification. Accumulating evidence that this energy fraction, or mixing efficiency R_f, significantly varies depending on flow properties challenges this assumption, however. Here, the authors examine the implications of a varying mixing efficiency for ocean energetics and deep-water mass transformation. Combining current parameterizations of internal wave-driven mixing with a recent model expressing R_f as a function of a turbulence intensity parameter Re_b = \epsilon_\nu / \nu N^2, the ratio of dissipation \epsilon_\nu to stratification N^2 and molecular viscosity \nu, it is shown that accounting for reduced mixing efficiencies in regions of weak stratification or energetic turbulence (high Re_b) strongly limits the ability of breaking internal waves to supply oceanic potential energy and drive abyssal upwelling. Moving from a fixed R_f = 1/6 to a variable efficiency R_f(Re_b) causes Antarctic Bottom Water upwelling induced by locally dissipating internal tides and lee waves to fall from 9 to 4 Sverdrups (Sv; 1 Sv \equiv 10^6 m^3 s^-1) and the corresponding potential energy source to plunge from 97 to 44 GW. When adding the contribution of remotely dissipating internal tides under idealized distributions of energy dissipation, the total rate of Antarctic Bottom Water upwelling is reduced by about a factor of 2, reaching 5Ð15 Sv, compared to 10Ð33 Sv for a fixed efficiency. The results suggest that distributed mixing, overflow-related boundary processes, and geothermal heating are more effective in consuming abyssal waters than topographically enhanced mixing by breaking internal waves. These calculations also point to the importance of accurately constraining R_f (Re_b) and including the effect in ocean models.
