TEA-COSIâ€¦ COPY 1-SENTENCE PROJECT DESCRIPTION FROM WEBSITE
TEA-COSI highlights include: the first observational quantification of the seasonal cycle of ice and ocean transports of heat and freshwater across the Arctic Oceanâ€™s gateways; and the assessment of the overturning circulation of the Arctic Ocean and its drivers from boundary measurements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://projects.noc.ac.uk/andrex/">ANDREX</a> - <strong>Antarctic Deep Water Rates of Export</strong> (NERC)<br />
The ANDREX project investigated the role of the Weddell Gyre in driving the southern closure of the meridional overturning circulation, in ventilating the deep global ocean, and in sequestering carbon and nutrients in the global ocean abyss. ANDREX highlights include: the assessment of the overturning circulation across the Weddell Gyre and its thermodynamical controls from observations; the discovery that Antarctic Bottom Water export from the Gyre is controlled by wind forcing; and the determination of the Weddell Gyre carbon sink and its underpinning dynamics.</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="meso--and-submesoscale-ocean-dynamics">Meso- and submesoscale ocean dynamics</h3>

<p><img src="/images/perpetual_ocean.jpg" style="padding:10px" align="left" width="300" /> One of the key research goals of our group is to unravel the dynamics of meso- and submesoscale flows and how they shape the large-scale ocean circulation. To this end, we perform targeted process experiments using a variety of measurement technologies, and guide our interpretation of the observations with idealised and realistic models.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/projects/pgup/">P-GUP</a> -
<strong>Predictability of the GalÃ¡pagos Archipelago Upwelling Plume</strong> (Royal Society)<br />
P-GUP seeks to quantify and understand the meso- and submesoscale processes controlling the rate of upwelling around the GalÃ¡pagos Archipelago, which plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the iconic ecosystem of the region. In doing so, the project investigates the distinct dynamics of submesoscale flows in the equatorial ocean. The central tool of P-GUP is a submesoscale-permitting ocean circulation model of the eastern equatorial Pacific.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/projects/mermeed/">MerMEED</a> - 
<strong>Mechanisms responsible for Mesoscale Eddy Energy Dissipation</strong> (NERC)<br />
MerMEED investigates the processes responsible for the widespread dissipation of oceanic mesoscale eddies at western boundaries. The project combines focussed measurements of small-scale turbulence in four short research cruises, multi-year mooring and satellite observations, and multi-month glider surveys of mesoscale eddies impinging on the continental slope east of the Bahamas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://blog.antarctica.ac.uk/istar/">iSTAR</a> - <strong>Ice Sheet Stability</strong> (NERC)<br />
The iSTAR programme tackled the processes regulating the transport of heat and freshwater between the continental shelf break of the Amundsen Sea and the oceanic cavity beneath Pine Island Glacier, one of the fastest-melting ice shelves in Antarctica. iSTAR highlights included the first measurements of small-scale turbulence beneath the floating edges of the Antarctic Ice Sheet using an autonomous underwater vehicle, and the unravelling of how submesoscale instabilities regulate the export of meltwater from the ice shelf cavities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.osmosis.ac.uk/">OSMOSIS</a> - <strong>Ocean Surface Mixing, Ocean Submesoscale Interaction Study</strong> (NERC)<br />
OSMOSIS investigated the range of turbulent processes controlling the evolution of the ocean surface boundary layer. A central element of the project was the deployment of an array of moorings and gliders in a mid-gyre area of the Northeast Atlantic over a full annual period. This array obtained some of the first observational evidence of the existence of a seasonal cycle in upper-ocean submesoscale instabilities, and produced unprecedented measurements of the year-long evolution of turbulent dissipation in the surface boundary layer.</p>

<h3 id="ocean-mixing">Ocean mixing</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ws16336/IMG_3385_thumb.jpg" style="padding:10px" align="left" width="150" />  A central focus of our group is the study of small-scale turbulence in the ocean. Our work uses cutting-edge technologies to measure turbulent flows, and develops new analytical and theoretical approaches to document and investigate the finescale controls and large-scale impacts of small-scale turbulence.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/projects/dynopo/">DynOPO</a> - <strong>Dynamics of the Orkney Passage Outflow</strong> (NERC / NSF)<br />
DynOPO seeks to assess the dynamics underpinning the windâ€™s regulation of the properties of the Antarctic Bottom Water exported from the Weddell Gyre. The project focuses on the Orkney Passage, a narrow topographic cleft channelling much of the bottom water outflow from the Weddell Sea. DynOPO combines targeted measurements of small-scale turbulent mixing during a major research cruise, detailed surveys of the Orkney Passage with an autonomous underwater vehicle, multi-year mooring observations, and a high-resolution process model of the bottom water outflow through the passage.</p>

    <p><a href="/projects/ridgemix/">RidgeMix</a> -
<strong>A nutrient and carbon pump over mid-ocean ridges</strong> (NERC)<br />
RidgeMix investigates the lifecycle of internal tides generated at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and their role in driving turbulent mixing of nutrients and carbon across the upper layers of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. The project includes observations of small-scale turbulence over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge using ship-deployed microstructure profilers and gliders, and mooring-based measurements of the vertical structure, propagation and energy transport of internal tides radiating from the ridge.</p>

    <p><a href="http://dimes.ucsd.edu">DIMES</a> - <strong>Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean</strong> (NERC / NSF)<br />
DIMES set out to test and re-define the contemporary paradigm of Southern Ocean mixing and its grip on the meridional overturning circulation. The experiment involved a purposeful tracer release to assess the large-scale rates of isopycnal and diapycnal mixing across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), extensive measurements of small-scale turbulence in the ACC, and a mooring array to measure interactions between mesoscale eddies and the internal wave field. DIMES had several key highlights, including: the demonstration that strong turbulent mixing occurs over a wide depth range in the Southern Ocean; the association of this strong mixing with the breaking of lee waves, generated as the ACC impinges on rough topography; and the assessment of the relative roles of isopycnal and diapycnal mixing processes in balancing the meridional overturning circulation across the ACC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/ooc/PROJECTS/SOFINE/">SOFine</a> - <strong>Southern Ocean Finestructure</strong> (NERC / Australian Research Council)<br />
The Southern Ocean Finestructure (SOFine) project investigated the mechanisms by which abrupt water mass transformations are effected in ACC standing meanders. SOFine highlights included: the first measurements of small-scale turbulence in the deep Southern Ocean; and the discovery of a fingerprint of mesoscale eddy stirring suppression on the thermohaline structure of the ACC.</p>

DynOPO combines targeted measurements of small-scale turbulent mixing during a major research cruise, detailed surveys of the Orkney Passage with an autonomous underwater vehicle, multi-year mooring observations, and a high-resolution process model of the bottom water outflow through the passage.</p>

The iSTAR programme tackled the processes regulating the transport of heat and freshwater between the continental shelf break of the Amundsen Sea and the oceanic cavity beneath Pine Island Glacier, one of the fastest-melting ice shelves in Antarctica. iSTAR highlights included the first measurements of small-scale turbulence beneath the floating edges of the Antarctic Ice Sheet using an autonomous underwater vehicle, and the unravelling of how submesoscale instabilities regulate the export of meltwater from the ice shelf cavities.</p>

TEA-COSIâ€¦ COPY 1-SENTENCE PROJECT DESCRIPTION FROM WEBSITE
TEA-COSI highlights include: the first observational quantification of the seasonal cycle of ice and ocean transports of heat and freshwater across the Arctic Oceanâ€™s gateways; and the assessment of the overturning circulation of the Arctic Ocean and its drivers from boundary measurements.</p>

    <p><a href="http://dimes.ucsd.edu">DIMES</a> - <strong>Diapycnal and Isopycnal Mixing Experiment in the Southern Ocean</strong> (NERC / NSF)<br />
DIMES set out to test and re-define the contemporary paradigm of Southern Ocean mixing and its grip on the meridional overturning circulation. The experiment involved a purposeful tracer release to assess the large-scale rates of isopycnal and diapycnal mixing across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), extensive measurements of small-scale turbulence in the ACC, and a mooring array to measure interactions between mesoscale eddies and the internal wave field. DIMES had several key highlights, including: the demonstration that strong turbulent mixing occurs over a wide depth range in the Southern Ocean; the association of this strong mixing with the breaking of lee waves, generated as the ACC impinges on rough topography; and the assessment of the relative roles of isopycnal and diapycnal mixing processes in balancing the meridional overturning circulation across the ACC.</p>
